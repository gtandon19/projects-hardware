# projects-hardware

A collection combining all the projects worked on related to all things hardware. 

Projects worked on: 

- Smart Glasses: Worked on by RSO Women in ECE at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, crafting glasses that would provide basic information at eye-level via reflection off of sunglasses. 
  Skills Employed: Flutter App Development, ESP-32 Board (Bluetooth / charging facilities), OLED Display, Circuit Design
  
- Virtual Gloves: Team of 4 created a glove that would use flexing ability of the finger and force tough generated by fingertips to input a letter / character, replacing the need for a keyboard. Completed prototype that generated binary (1 finger with 2 flexes / forces generated)
  Skills Employed: Arduino Uno, Flex Sensors, Force Sensing Resistors, Python
  
- Superheterodyne AM Receiver: Created a functional Superheterodyne AM Receiver that would extract a modulated signal and demodulate it, complete with components as mentioned: Preselect Band-Pass Filter, IF Amplifier, Envelope Detector, Audio Amplifier and Loudspeaker.
  Skills Employed: Capacitor Circuit Analysis, Filter analysis, Modulation and Demodulation Properties, Circuit Analysis.
  
- ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory: Coded in SystemVerilog to emplpy functionalities and gian experience with FPGAs.
  Skills Employed: SystemVerilog, working with FPGAs, NIOS-II integrated SOC, USB Protocol
  
- ECE 110: Intro to Electronics: For the final project, constructed a circuit that would use the resistive ratios of a PWM signal to run the car in a stright line, and then built a car-lock system using a wheatstone bridge that would only let current flow if a specific resistor was used.
