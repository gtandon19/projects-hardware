# projects-hardware

A collection combining all the projects worked on related to all things hardware. 

Projects worked on: 

- Smart Glasses: Worked on by RSO Women in ECE at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, crafting glasses that would provide basic information at eye-level via reflection off of sunglasses. 
  Skills Employed: Flutter App Development, ESP-32 Board (Bluetooth / charging facilities), OLED Display, Circuit Design
- ECE 385: Digital Systems Laboratory: Coded in SystemVerilog to emplpy functionalities and gian experience with FPGAs.
  Skills Employed: SystemVerilog, working with FPGAs, NIOS-II integrated SOC
- ECE 110: Intro to Electronics: For the final project, constructed a circuit that would use the resistive ratios of a PWM signal to run the car in a stright line, and then built a car-lock system using a wheatstone bridge that would only let current flow if a specific resistor was used.
